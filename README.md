# Udacity_DeepLearnig_Nanodegree-Projects-2020
This repo contains my ongoing journey of Deep Learning Nanodegree with Udacity!!
There are projects related to Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree program. It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various Deep learning projects. In most cases, the notebooks lead you through implementing neural networks, using the deep learning framework like PyTorch. I learned how to build convolutional networks for image recognition, recurrent networks for sequence generation, generative adversarial networks for image generation, and learn how to deploy models accessible from a website.
In the program itself, the projects are reviewed by real people (Udacity reviewers). These notebooks are reviewed by Udacity reviewers.

# Prerequisite for this course :

- Python Programming
- Multivariable Calculus
- Linear Algebra

# PROJECT 1: Neural Networks- (Predicting Bike-sharing Patterns)
In this project, you will make a neural network to solve a prediction problem in a real dataset! By building a neural network from scratch, you will understand much better how the gradient, backpropagation, and other important concepts work before we start using other tools further in the course such as TensorFlow. You also get a chance to see your network solving a real problem! In this project, you'll predict bike ridership using a simple neural network.

# PROJECT 2:. Convolutional Networks- (Dog-Breed Classifier)
In this project, you'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. You'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. Then, you'll use a pretrained neural network (VGGnet), using a technique known as transfer learning. At the end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.

# PROJECT 3:. Recurrent Neural Networks- (Generate TV scripts)
In this part, you’ll learn about Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) — it is well suited to data that forms sequences like text, music, and time series data. You'll build a recurrent neural network that can generate new text character by character.Then, you'll learn about word embeddings and implement the Word2Vec model, a network that can learn about semantic relationships between words.You'll combine embeddings and an RNN to predict the sentiment of movie reviews.In this project, you'll use what you've learned here to generate new TV scripts from episodes of The Simpson's.

# PROJECT 4: Generative Adversarial Networks- (Generate Faces)
In this, you'll use a deep convolutional GAN to generate completely new images of human faces.

# PROJECT 5: Deploying A Sentiment Analysis Model
In this module,you will learned how to deploy train & deploy model using Amazon AWS and Sagemaker. Builed a Semtiment Analysis Model on Sagemaker and deployed the same using AWS Sagemaker prebuild functionality.
