So here is the final SageMaker deployment project! In this project I have constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of
determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition,
I have deployed my model and constructed a simple web app which interacts with the deployed model.
It is done on Amazon Sagemaker, from model training to deployment.
