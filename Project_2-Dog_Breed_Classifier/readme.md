In this project, I learned how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.
Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will
identify the resembling dog breed.

In this project, I have build and trained 2 CNN classifiers in PyTorch :

- Building CNN classifier from scratch
- Build CNN classifier using Transfer Learning
